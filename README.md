I'm a recent EECS graduate from UC Berkeley interested in firmware development. I am currently searching for a full-time position where I can put my skillset to use creating impactful technology.

While searching, I have been working part-time at Outside Open to develop a decorative display of real-time traffic conditions in the greater Los Angeles area. Please feel free to contact me with any questions about the firmware, hardware, or obtaining a prototype!
