I am a recent graduate from UC Berkeley with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am currently searching for a full-time position, ideally as a firmware engineer or low-level C/C++ developer where I can continue to develop my skillset and grow as an engineer.

I have worked on many projects that demonstrate my proficiency in developing large systems, most notably a disassembler for the MSP430 microcontroller, the implementation of various components of the Pintos educational operating system, and an encrypted file system. I am currently working on a board which displays traffic via leds using an ESP32 with the ESP-IDF SDK.

I am eager to begin my career and contribute to real-world projects using the skills I have developed at UC Berkeley.
