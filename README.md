I am a Firmware Engineer based in Santa Barbara with a B.S in EECS from UC Berkeley. Recently I have been working part-time at Outside Open to develop a decorative display of real-time traffic conditions in the greater Los Angeles area using an ESP32. Feel free to contact me with any questions about the project, obtaining a prototype, or with questions about ESP-IDF and the VSCode extension!
