I'm Jaden Baptista, a freshman at SBCC pursuing a degree in computer science.
I learned a little python (check out my snake repository built in tkinter) and have since switched to java.
I am currently working on software to increase office efficiency at my job while also
trying to focus on competitive programming.

You can reach me at baptistajaden@gmail.com.
