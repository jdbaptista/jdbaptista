Hello!

I am a sophomore at Santa Barbara City College majoring in computer science.
I have extensive experience in Java, and have learned C++, C, Python, HTML,
CSS, JS, and jquery.

I am balancing my studies with competitive programming and personal projects.
I am currently working on a fullstack office app that consists of a Spring
Boot server and Electron based client.

View my progress here: https://github.com/jdbaptista/Office.
I should note that this is currently being built in a private repo designed
specifically for one small company and that I will create a generic app later.
